# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset from IBM Cognos Analytics containing customer demographics, service usage, and billing information, we develop models to forecast the likelihood of churn, enabling telecom companies to take proactive measures for customer retention.

# Objectives
To determine the churn rate among telecom customers.

Identify any gender-based or service usage patterns among churned customers.

Ascertain which telecom services are most associated with churn and profitability.

# Methodology

CRISP-DM Approach: Followed a structured data mining approach including business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment phases.

Data Preparation: Utilized IBM Cognos Analytics dataset with extensive data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Development: Implemented various machine learning models including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression to predict customer churn.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Confusion Matrix.

# Key Findings

Churn Insights: Identified key factors influencing customer churn, including service types and customer payment methods.

Model Performance: Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Feature Importance: Identified significant features contributing to churn prediction, enabling targeted customer retention strategies.

# Deployment and Future Work

The best-performing model, Gradient Boosting, was selected for deployment with hyper-parameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy.

Future scope includes integrating the model into a production environment and hosting results on a dedicated website for real-time churn prediction and insights.

# Conclusion
Our machine learning model offers actionable insights for telecom companies to improve customer retention rates. By identifying key churn factors, companies can devise targeted strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs and enhance profitability.
